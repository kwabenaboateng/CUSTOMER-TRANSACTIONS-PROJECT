# Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

 - customer_transactions_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the main analysis and visualization code.
 - data/: Directory to store the dataset and any additional data files.
 - output/: Directory to store any output files generated during the analysis.
 - scripts/: Python scripts used for data preprocessing and analysis.
 - visualizations/: Images and charts generated during the analysis.

# Data
The dataset used for this project is stored in the data/ directory. The data consists of customer transaction records with the following columns:

 - customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.
 - Name: First name of the customer.

# Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer transactions data to answer important business questions. The analysis includes:

 - Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distribution, identifying trends, and calculating descriptive statistics.
 - Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on their transaction behavior.
 - Product Analysis: Identifying the best-selling products and product categories.
 - Time-based Analysis: Analyzing transaction patterns over time.
